            <h2>Why Clean Up</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Cleaning up beaches is essential for preserving marine ecosystems, as it prevents pollution from harming wildlife and disrupting natural habitats. 
                Removing litter and waste also ensures that beaches remain safe and enjoyable for people, promoting public health and recreation. Additionally, clean beaches support local economies 
                by attracting tourists and enhancing the beauty of coastal areas. Overall, beach cleanups play a crucial role in maintaining the environmental and economic health of coastal communities.

                    impact on the ocean. A single cigarette butt can contaminate 8 liters of water after just one hour of 
                    soaking in the waves. This contamination can then drift deeper into the ocean, affecting marine life far 
                    from the coastline.</p>

                    end up in waterways. This shift in behavior highlights the potential for individual actions to significantly

                    <p>In 2018, over 1 million volunteers across 22 countries participated in the International Coastal Cleanup, 
                    collecting plastic pollution along more than 22,000 miles of coastline. This massive effort underscores 
                    the global commitment to addressing ocean pollution and the role of citizen science in gathering data and 
                    removing trash from coastlines.</p>

                    poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems. With estimates suggesting that billions of plastic microfibers 
                    are present in the ocean per square kilometer, the importance of removing every piece of trash becomes clear. 
                    This emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to clean up existing pollution and prevent future contributions.</p>
